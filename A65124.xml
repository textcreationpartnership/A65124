         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>My Lord, Thoſe many Gracious and Regal Grants and Priviledges which his moſt <hi>Excellent Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Royal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors (of ever bleſſed Memory)</hi> have from time to time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon this his Majeſties <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>Virginia,</hi> ſince the firſt Settlement of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, have given being to theſe <hi>Laws</hi> for the better Government thereof; it being impoſſible for any number of Men to be at Peace or to flouriſh and proſper without good <hi>Laws,</hi> which are the firm Pillars of Government, and the ſtrong Bonds of all Humane Society. One had as good live in a Deſart amongſt Savage Beaſts, as among Men without <hi>Law</hi> to defend him; for <hi>Laws</hi> are the Hedges on either ſide the Road, which hinders from breaking into other Mens Propriety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laws</hi> are every Mans Civil Armour, that Guards him from the Gripes of Rapine and all other Outragious Aſſaults and Inſolencies, and indeed 'tis for this chiefly that <hi>Laws</hi> are of uſe amongſt us, not only to be our Guide, but alſo our Shield.</p>
            <p>The Great and Univerſal Monarch of the World, the Supream Being, at firſt, in the very Infancy of Time gave unto Man a Law upon <hi>Parole,</hi> inſcribed in his heart, that by thoſe inward Dictates he might be guided and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the whole Courſe and Road of his Life; but ſuch has the Pravity of Humane Nature been, that this Divine Inſcription is in a great meaſure defaced; ſo that Kings and Princes have found it of abſolute neceſſity to give Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Preſcripted <hi>Laws</hi> for the Government and Well-being of Mankind in their reſpective Places and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.</p>

But my Lord, theſe Papers which contain <hi>Laws,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to preſerve others from Calumny and Cenſures, yet cannot themſelves; humbly crave your Excellencies Patronage, which proves a Sanctuary to all Goodneſs, ſo well as your Power is a Terror to all Vice.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of this Collection of <hi>Laws</hi> is the Good of the Inhabitants of this Place, for <hi>Laws</hi> though Enacted, ſtand in little ſtead and uſe till they are promulgated and made known to all perſons concerned in the Obedience of them: Not my Lord that I accuſe all the Inhabitants here with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of their Duty, but, may it pleaſe your Excellency, The knowledg of all things that are good, the more diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive the better, and I hope my Lord, that my honeſt and good intent herein will leſſen and expiate in ſome meaſure my preſumption in this Dedication to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</p>
            <p>Your Illuſtrious Fore-fathers have been always famous for their conſtant and exemplary Loyalty to their <hi>Prince,</hi> and ſome of them have received the Signal Marks of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bounty. Your Excellency has eminently and deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partaken of both, for his moſt Sacred Majeſty (whom God grant long to Reign) ſeeing you treading in the ſame Steps of Loyalty with your Vertuous and Noble Anceſtors, hath in his Princely Wiſdom been pleaſed to entruſt your Lordſhip with the Weighty and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Employment of <hi>Lieutenant</hi> and <hi>Governour General</hi> of <hi>VIRGINIA.</hi>

            <p>But my Lord, I dare not extend my ſelf upon your Excellencies Panegyrick, which is an infinite Subject, and requires the Pen of the moſt Skilful Orator: I ſhall therefore content my ſelf to admire with other Men what I cannot comprehend, leſt I ſhould offend and be injurious to your Excellency by my little and weak Expreſſions, which are far below my thoughts, and my thoughts far below your great and high Merits; which neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily forces all Men (whoſe happineſs 'tis to know your Lordſhip) to aſpire, and I more than all others, to take the liberty to write and ſtile my ſelf</p>

This
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38000:6"/> Aſſembly taking the ſame into their ſerious Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and gravely weighing the Obligations they are to diſcharge to God, the King, and the Countrey, have by ſettling the Laws, diligently endeavoured to prevent the like Inconveniencies, by cauſing the whole Body of the Laws to be revived, all unneceſſary Acts, and chiefly ſuch as might keep in memory our forced deviation from His Majeſties Obedience, to be repealed and expunged; and thoſe that are in force to be brought into one Volume: And leſt any prejudice might ariſe by the ignorance of the Times from whence thoſe Acts were in force, they have added the Dates of every Act, to the end that Courts might rightly adminiſter Juſtice and give Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence according to Law for any thing happening at any time ſince any Law was in force: And have alſo endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in all things as near as the Capacity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Countrey would admit, to adhere to thoſe excellent and often refined Laws of <hi>England,</hi> to which we profeſs and acknowledge all Reverence and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

And becauſe it is impoſſible to honour the King as we ſhould, unleſs we ſerve and fear God as we ought.
